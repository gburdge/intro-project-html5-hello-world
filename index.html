	    	<p> "Hello, World! programs have become the basic phrase for a newby learning to code. 
	    	Simple enough so that people who have no experience with computer programming can 
	    	easily understand it.</p> 
	     	<p>It can also be a useful sanity test to make sure that a 
	    	language's compiler, development environment, and run-time environment are correctly 
	    	installed.</p> 
	    	<p>Additionally it is sometimes used by computer hackers as a proof of concept that 
	    	arbitrary code can be executed through an exploit where the system designers did not 
	    	intend code to be executed." ~ paraphrased from <em>Wikipedia</em></p>
